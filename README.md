CVE-2015-2231 Proof of Concept

The POC I was using to demonstrate [CVE-2015-2231 'Get Super Serial'](https://github.com/rednaga/disclosures/blob/master/GetSuperSerial.md). Was asked by a few people to post it so they could use similar things on other ADUPS firmware based devices which have this vulnerability. Cleaning up the laptop and posting this before it gets lost.
